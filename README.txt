# Vincent Guo - 10/5/2025

# Update plans:
    # Handle full inventory
    # Handle broken rods
    # Fix recast/retrieve after the catch. Program sample rate prompts it to recast again even after it retrieved from a catch because bobber splash message still lingers

# Notes, please read:
    # Turn on minecraft subtitles. Options > Music & sound > closed caption > ON
    # Terminate program my closing terminal or keyboard interrupt with ctrl+c when the terminal is pulled up
    # Works best when Minecraft is split screen. Program is ~25% of the left and Minecraft is ~75% of the right

# Thank you for trying out this program. Feel free to contact me about this program via Discord: @livelovelean
