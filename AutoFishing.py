# Vincent Guo - 10/5/2025

# Update plans:
    # CRITICAL - recasts a second time after retrieving for some reason. Problem caused by sample rate being high and seeing bobber splash after it has already retrieved
    # Handle full inventory
    # Handle broken rods
    # Allow full screen

# Notes, please read:
    # Run following command in terminal (open terminal with ctrl+~) to install:
        # pip install easyocr rich pyautogui numpy
    
    # Turn on minecraft subtitles. Music & sound > closed caption > ON
    # Program keyboard interrupt with ctrl+C or kill terminal
    # Works best if minecraft is on split screen. Program is ~25% of the left and minecraft is ~75% of the right 
    # Start the AutoFishing.py program on vsc or cmd. Tab into minecraft and afk fish
